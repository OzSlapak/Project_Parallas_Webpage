        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The history of Canada covers the period from the arrival of the
            Paleo-Indians to North America thousands of years ago to the
            present day. Prior to European colonization, the lands encompassing
            present-day Canada were inhabited for millennia by Indigenous peoples,
            with distinct trade networks, spiritual beliefs, and styles of social
            organization. Some of these older civilizations had long faded by the
            time of the first European arrivals and have been discovered through
            archeological investigations</p>
